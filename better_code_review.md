Challenges and solutions
------------------------

- Being Right solutions: 
	- define style guides
	- use linters
	- check complexity
	- code coverage

- Generalizations solutions:
	- can you show me what you mean?
	- specificity

- Labeling
	- no ad hominem attacks
	- clarify "what changes should I make to make this more idiomatic?" rather than "as a junior programmer you wouldn't understand"
	- act as a guide

- Guessing Game solutions:
	- be aware of tone and manner during review
	- "I'm confused about what that means, where should we start?"
	

Philosophy
----------

- Gut check, look for
	- physical discomfort
	- silence of one or more parties
	- fatigue

- Handle it:
	- change physical situation
	- "here's how I'm feeling, I need to take a break"
	- "Let's pick this up again tomorrow"
	- feel free to pause
