Keynote with Christian Heilman
==============================

Issues
------
- We've become too enamored with our own apps
- Stop building apps for everything
- Too many unclear layers on top of building static pages
- Assuming platform (EVERYONE USES MACS RIGHT, RIGHT?)

Philosophy changes(?)
---------------------
- Build for the user
- Build for real use cases
- Solve actual problems before making pretty interfaces
- Progressive enhancement, Graceful degredation is double the work
- Build for offline first

Learn and build new things
--------------------------
- Learn from AppCache - everyone complains, no one uses
- Service worker: a tech that needs help improving
- Web components
	- Render with the browser
	- Less power use
	- Richer interfaces
	- Real application interfaces in web 
	- Custom elements are potential hazard if used in the hammer methodology
	- Useful for modular design
	- 4 different standards already in browsers
		- Shadow DOM (DOM & style encapsulation boundaries)
		- HTML Templates (in browser-templating that are available for rendering)
		- Custom elements (create new interface elements, inheritable) -> DON'T BUILD A BUTTON, INHERIT IT
		- HTML Imports (importing segments of code?)
	- Roadmap?

The future
----------
- Let's stop boohooing
- Work together
