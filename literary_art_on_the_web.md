Literary Art on teh Web
=======================

Why
---

- understand ourselves
	- people in data, data in the perspective of people
	- humanities see tech as foreign
	- tech excludes humanities
	- make them fall in love
- understand the systems to which we are subjected and to which we subject others
	- in the current state of systems, there is a defensive nature to the way data is being use
	- data art as a way of helping explain and elaborate on systems
- expand our horizons
	- experiment with data visualizations
	- non-standard methods
	- useful
	- positive
	- attractive
- it's fun
