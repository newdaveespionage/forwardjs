Lessons
-------
- Let your process crash
	- pm2 has built-in load balancer (newer)
	- forever (older, more established)
- Find issues
	- node-inspector
		- can inspect run-time
		- in browser (web-inspector)
- Possible to build entire infrastructure in node
- Don't use node for decrypting SSL 
- Backbone.js front-end
- No asterisks in npm versions (too risky)
	- use specific version
	- build strategy to update
	- do not rely on devs using semver
-
